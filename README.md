MSc. in Engineering in Modeling and Simulation of processes from the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I have extensive experience in Data Analytics, Data Modeling and Statistics as a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, Project Management. During the Master's Degree I worked as a graduate researcher in a joint project with Petrobras to classify areas in industrial processes using statistical analysis and mathematical modeling of data. In recent times I have specialized in data analysis with Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau and R. I have one year of international experience as an exchange student at Universities: University of Nebraska - Lincoln and University of California - Los Angeles.

Computational Background: Python | Power BI | SQL | R | MATLAB | Tableau
